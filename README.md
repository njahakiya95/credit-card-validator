# credit-card-validator

This project uses Luhn's Algorithm to determine whether or not a user-input 
credit card number is valid or not. This algorithm was created by a group 
of mathematicians in the 1960's and is still used when a credit card transaction
is attempted at a terminal. 

The code was written using C++ and run in Visual Studio Code IDE, but should be 
able to be run in any environment.
